<h3>Usage:</h3><br>

The required columns to run this tool is:<br>
*ClientIP,ClientRequestHost,ClientRequestMethod,ClientRequestURI,EdgeStartTimestamp,ZoneName,ClientASN,ClientCountry*,<br>
*ClientDeviceType,ClientSrcPort,ClientRequestBytes,ClientRequestPath,ClientRequestReferer,ClientRequestScheme,ClientRequestUserAgent*<br>


However the code has a little flexibility to handle some variations on it. Just don't be to much wild.<br><br>

To run this script, youâ€™ll need to use the Docker basic comands as suggested in the examples bellow:<br>



A initial sample could be done with this sample: https://gist.githubusercontent.com/cloudwalk-tests/3c82d813645f547618b3ea81b6d269b8/raw/e0006a126b85782d95a655977deeabbb2b41d0c7/test-dataset.csv<br>

**1)Add data**:Fisrt add a sample of data in .CSV format for machine learning training.<br>

``

This can be done manually or you can automate this process as suggested bellow, in this case provide your customized changes:<br>

# Example of scripts to upload and remove data from the container 
- [Add-data](add-data.sh)<br>
- [Remove-data](remove-data.sh)<br>


To remove the data manualy, run:<br>

``

2)Finally, to run the script, simply execute the following command:<br>

`sudo docker run --rm w1ndx/network-traffic-analyzer:first python3 ./network_trf_analyzer.py`

An interestion ideia would be setup a daemon to run this 24/7, for example.
