<h3>Deliverables of Network Traffic Analyzer for Security Monitoring Tool</h3><br>

This tool is designed to analyze and monitor network traffic in real-time to identify potential security risks and anomalies. The system processes traffic data, detects suspicious patterns, and applies a security policy to mitigate threats such as DDoS attacks, brute-force attempts, and geo-location-based risks.<br><br> By leveraging machine learning models like Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM, and Autoencoders, the script can detect unusual traffic patterns and behaviors, offering a more adaptive and intelligent approach to network security.<br><br>

<h3>Key Features:</h3><br>
**1. Anomaly Detection with Machine Learning:**<br>
The tool uses various machine learning models to analyze traffic patterns and detect anomalies that may indicate malicious activity.<br>

**Isolation Forest:** This model detects outliers in the traffic data by identifying data points that deviate significantly from the rest, helping to uncover anomalies like sudden traffic spikes.<br>

**One-Class SVM (Support Vector Machine):** It is used to identify traffic that doesn't conform to the norm, helping detect rare or abnormal behaviors in the network traffic.<br>

**Autoencoders:** A neural network model that reconstructs the input data. When the reconstructed data has a high error, it indicates that the traffic doesn't follow expected patterns, which is flagged as potentially malicious or anomalous.<br><br>

**2. Geolocation-Based Threat Detection:**<br>
GeoIP filtering is used to identify traffic coming from high-risk or suspicious countries.<br>

**GeoIP Filtering:** The system can identify suspicious traffic originating from countries known for hosting cybercriminals or malicious activity, such as North Korea, Russia, and China.<br>

**Blocking/Flagging:** Suspicious traffic from high-risk regions can be flagged for further scrutiny or blocked, depending on the severity of the risk.<br><br>

**3. Traffic Volume Monitoring:**<br>
The tool monitors network traffic patterns and flags suspicious volumes of requests, which may indicate certain types of attacks.<br>

**DDoS Detection:** By monitoring request frequencies, the system can detect Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks that often involve abnormal traffic spikes or a large number of requests from a single IP.<br>

**Brute-force Detection:** The system can flag abnormal spikes in login attempts or repeated requests from the same IP, helping to detect brute-force attacks on authentication systems.<br><br>

**4. IP Hashing and Data Encryption:** <br>
To ensure privacy and comply with data protection regulations, the system anonymizes sensitive data.<br>

**IP Hashing:** The IP addresses in the network traffic are hashed to anonymize them, ensuring that sensitive user data is not exposed.<br>

**Encryption:** The traffic data is encrypted during the analysis process, keeping sensitive information secure from unauthorized access or leaks.<br><br>

**5. Policy Enforcement:**<br>
The script applies a basic security policy to detect anomalies and respond to suspicious activity.<br>

**Anomaly Response:** Malicious IPs are flagged, and the system can potentially block traffic from suspicious regions or addresses based on the detected anomalies.<br>

**Traffic Blocking:** Although the script doesn’t implement advanced blocking mechanisms like a firewall, it can flag suspicious traffic for further investigation or manual blocking based on the analysis.<br><br>

**6. Scalability and Adaptability:**<br>
The tool is designed to handle varying sizes of traffic datasets and can adapt to different network patterns.<br>

**Flexible Parameters:** The solution is flexible, with tunable parameters for the models (e.g., contamination rates, anomaly detection thresholds) to suit different traffic conditions or specific use cases.<br>

**Scalable Infrastructure:** The tool can scale to handle larger datasets and integrate with other existing security tools or monitoring platforms.<br><br>

**7. Real-Time Anomaly Detection:**<br>
The system provides real-time anomaly detection powered by machine learning.<br>

**Automated Detection:** With machine learning models in place, the tool can automatically detect anomalous behavior without needing predefined thresholds, making it adaptable to evolving threats.<br><br>

**8. Threat Detection and Identification:**<br>
The system is capable of identifying specific types of attacks by monitoring traffic patterns and behaviors.<br>

**DDoS (Denial-of-Service) Attacks:** Identified by monitoring traffic volume and detecting spikes in request patterns that may suggest an ongoing DDoS attack.<br>

**Brute-Force Attacks:** The system can detect repeated requests or login attempts from specific IPs, a common sign of brute-force attacks.<br>

**Port Scanning & Reconnaissance:** The system recognizes unusual patterns of requests to multiple ports within a short timeframe, which can indicate port scanning or reconnaissance activity.<br>

**IP Spoofing:** Detects discrepancies between the reported IP addresses and geolocation data, potentially indicating IP spoofing attempts.<br>

**Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks:** Although the system doesn't perform in-depth SSL/TLS analysis, it can flag potential MITM attacks by monitoring DNS spoofing attempts and suspicious HTTP header alterations.<br>

**Geolocation-Based Threats:** Traffic from high-risk countries is flagged, which helps prevent attacks originating from these regions.<br><br>

**9. Logging and Reporting:**<br>
The system logs all detected anomalies, suspicious activity, and flagged IPs for further analysis.<br>

**Comprehensive Logging:** All actions (e.g., flagged IPs, anomaly scores, suspicious regions) are logged to ensure that the analysis process can be reviewed and investigated later.<br>

**Alerts for Suspicious Activity:** While the script doesn't implement real-time alerting systems (such as email or SMS notifications), all anomalies and flagged traffic can be logged for later review, enabling manual intervention when necessary.<br><br>

**Conclusion:**<br>
This network traffic monitoring tool effectively detects and analyzes a variety of potential security risks, including DDoS attacks, brute-force attempts, port scanning, IP spoofing, and geolocation-based threats. The use of machine learning models enhances the system's ability to identify complex anomalies in real-time, while privacy features like IP hashing and data encryption ensure compliance with privacy standards. The tool is scalable and adaptable, capable of handling different traffic patterns and integrating with other security solutions.<br><br>

Though the system doesn’t yet have automated blocking or alerting features, it provides the foundation for detecting and analyzing traffic anomalies, which can be expanded in future versions.<br>
