<h3>Acknowledgments</h3><br>
I'm really thankfull for this team that with only a request made my mind expand and grow in so many directions in such a little time.<br>
I really appreciated and enjoyed this experience. I want more.<br>
I'm hungry to be part of the pack!<br><br>

<h3>Considerations:</h3><br>
This tool were developed as result of a ethical hacker challenge for a job application and it’s not designed to be perfect, but to be flexible to be improved over time in performance, secure coding, etc.<br><br>
Feel free to study it and adapt it into your reality if it makes sense to you.<br>

*Do not use this script as it is in real environments, once it was not fully tested and may lead to impacts in the network, data leaks, etc *.<br>
*It’s dedicate to study only! I won’t accept responsibilities for any damage caused by it’s irresponsible or illegal use*.<br>
*Do not run it where you don’t have express and legal consent*!<br>
*Commercial use of this script is not recommended once it was developed with help of ChatGPT*.<br>
*As it is now, this tool might have serious logic flaws, vulnerable packges and misconfigurations that maybe can be fixed some day, but not today. So again: do not run it in real environments!*
