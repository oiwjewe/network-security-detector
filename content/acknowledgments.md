<h3>Acknowledgments</h3>
I'm really thankfull for this team that with only a request made my mind expand and grow in so many directions in such a little time.<br>
I really appreciated and enjoyed this experience.<br>
I want more. I'm hungry to be part of the pack!<br>

<h3>Considerations:</h3>
This script were developed as result of a hacker challenge for a job application, so it won’t be perfect. It’s not designed to be perfect, but to be flexible so it could be improved over time.<br>
Feel free to study it and adapt it into your reality if it makes sense to you.<br>

I do not recommend or suggest to use this script as it is in real environments, once it was not fully tested and may lead to impacts in the network, such internal IP blocks while AI is learning.<br>
It’s dedicate to study only! I won’t accept responsibilities for any damage caused by it’s irresponsible or illegal use.<br>
Do not run it in networks where you don’t have express and legal consent.<br>
Commercial use of this script is not recommended once it was developed with help of ChatGPT.<br>
