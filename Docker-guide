USAGE:

To run this script, you will need to use the Docker image available in Docker Hub.

For this, follow the instructions bellow.

For other distributions and systems or troubleshooting errors that may occur during Docker installation in your environment, please refer to the official Docker documentation at https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/

--------------

If Docker is already installed in your environment, skip to step 5:

Run the comands in your terminal:

#1)Check if Docker is installed: 
docker --version

#2)Check Docker service status: 
sudo systemctl status docker

#3)Update packages: 
sudo apt update && apt upgrade -y && apt autoremove

#4)Install Docker: 
sudo apt install docker.io docker-compose

#5)Download the Docker image:
sudo docker pull <network-security-detector:tag>

#6)See the Docker images available in your environment: 
sudo docker images

#7)Build the image:
sudo docker build -t network-security-detector .

#8)Finally, to run the script, simply execute the following command:
sudo docker run --rm <network-security-detector:tag> python3 ./network_trf_analyzer.py

need improve:
This will start the Python script inside the container. If your script needs to access external files (like network traffic data or models), you can use Docker volumes or make sure the files are copied into the image.

#OR run it in BACKGROUND:
sudo docker run -d --name network-security-detector-container network-security-detector


--------

Plus, you can also build the image to run this script by replicating the Dockerfile available in this repository in your environment if you're familiar with Docker technology. It uses the oficial python image by the way.

--------
See CONSIDERATIONS and Enjoy it :)
